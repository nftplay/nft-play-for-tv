NFT Play uses WalletConnect linking to your wallet, so that you don’t have to worry about the security problem. WalletConnect is an open source protocol and compatible on IOS and Android Wallet.

If you have more than one NFT artworks, you can edit a playlist, set transition speed, and also repeat playing one artwork. You are able to find out the details of specific NFT artwork, e.g. creator, unique identification, owner, etc.. Now, NFT Play is only compatible with ERC-721 NFT on Ethereum.
